# BIOSInspector
BIOS Inspector: object-oriented C++ system for UEFI firmware inspection. Extracts modules, collects metadata, computes hashes, identifies GUIDs and sensitive strings, generates reports, experimentally executes modules via Qiling, and creates reports (using DAO pattern) to record everything. Functional prototype with UML, STL, and concurrency.

The project was developed in the context of the Applied Computing Graduate Program (PPGCA) at the Federal University of Technology – Paraná (UTFPR), specifically for the Advanced Programming course, in the second semester of 2025, under the supervision of Professor Robson Ribeiro Linhares, PhD.
