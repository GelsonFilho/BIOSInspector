# BIOSInspector
BIOS Inspector: object-oriented C++ system for UEFI firmware inspection. Extracts modules, collects metadata, computes hashes, identifies GUIDs and sensitive strings, generates reports, experimentally executes modules via Qiling, and creates reports (using DAO pattern) to record everything. Functional prototype with UML, STL, and concurrency.
